Steps to Add a Bookmarklet:

1. Create a New Bookmark (Any Page):
- You can't directly create a bookmarklet without first creating a regular bookmark. So, start by bookmarking any page. It doesn't matter which one. You can do this by:
  - Clicking the star icon in the address bar.
  - Pressing Ctrl+D (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+D (macOS).
  - Right-clicking on a page and selecting "Bookmark This Page".
  - Going to "Bookmarks" > "Bookmark This Page" in the Firefox menu.

2. Edit the Bookmark:
- Find the bookmark you just created. The easiest way is usually:
  - Bookmarks Toolbar: If the bookmark is on your toolbar, right-click on it.
  - Bookmarks Menu: If it's in the Bookmarks menu, click the menu, find the bookmark, and right-click on it.
  - Bookmarks Manager: Press Ctrl+Shift+O (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+O (macOS) to open the Library (Bookmarks Manager). Find your bookmark there, and right-click it.
    - From the right-click menu, select "Edit Bookmark" (or a similar option like "Properties" â€“ the wording might vary slightly depending on your Firefox version).

3. Paste the JavaScript Code:
- Crucially: In the edit window, find the field labeled "Location" (or sometimes "URL"). This is where the magic happens.
- Replace the existing URL with your bookmarklet code. The code must start with javascript:. This prefix tells the browser to execute the code instead of treating it as a web address.
